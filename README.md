I have took high resolution screen snips from USGS site and data is of Sentinel-1 with 10% of cloud cover


The Data consists of variety of Man-made structures from places all over the world like form every continent, like urban areas, ultra urban areas, villages, agricultural lands, household areas, etc.
and also the naturally occurring different kinds of landscapes like mountain, glaciers, frozen sea/ lakes, desert from multiple continents, forest covers, almost every naturally occurring landscapes but those areas unintervened or are without any kind of man made infrastructure from all over every continent.
